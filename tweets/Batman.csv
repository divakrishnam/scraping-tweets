ussoldado,Josh Jackson,2020-01-10 23:59:04,The fact that prestige is somehow basically last makes me hate all of you. Unpopular opinion: The Batman series wasnt even that good after the first one. The third was crap and the second one is only remembered for Ledger's transcendental performance.,0,0,1

nevebelle,Katie Golden 🦔🦊,2020-01-10 23:57:49,"It seems like your comment intends to expose me for a lack of knowledge about Batman and Cat Woman's relationship rather than critically engage the topic, so it feels condescending. I'm happy to discuss the aspect of context in friendly discourse, though!",1,0,1
